**Motivation**

New York City transit demand fluctuates with extreme weather events and large-scale city events (i.e. parades, holiday gatherings). This project analyzes how weather conditions and permitted events from 2024-2025 affect Manahattan station-level ridership. Manhattan hosts the majority of major NYC events and has consistent weather monitoring in Central Park, making it ideal for this study. Findings will inform service planning, system resilience, and rider communications.

**Intended Final Products**

The main output will be empirical estimates of magnitude and timing of ridership changes. We will also include a preliminary predictive model for short-term ridership changes during future weather extremes and major events.

**Anticipated Data Sources**  

* **MTA Subway Hourly Ridership:** Station-level hourly ridership for 123 Manhattan stations; datasets `wujg-7c2s` (2024) and `5wq4-mkjj` (2025) from NY Open Data; ~1.92M hourly observations
* **Weather Data:** NOAA GHCN-Daily from Central Park Station (USW00094728) including daily maximum temperature, precipitation, and snowfall (2024-2025)
* **NYC Permitted Events:** Event permits from NYC Open Data including dates, locations, and event types for Manhattan (2024-2025)
* **Station Geocoding:** MTA station complex locations with coordinates for spatial analysis

**Planned Analyses, Visualizations, and Coding Challenges**  

* ***Data Wrangling:*** Define weather indicators for heat waves and storms. Geocode event locations and spatially join to the nearest station complex.
* ***Modeling:*** Within-station fixed effects models controlling for station and date fixed effects to estimate  impacts of weather and events on log(ridership). Hourly event-window analyses for selected venues.
* ***Sensitivity Analysis:*** Alternative weather thresholds and station type interactions.
* ***Visualizations:*** Calendar heatmaps and time series plots for high-traffic stations; Manhattan maps showing percent change in ridership during heat waves, storms, and major events
* ***Coding Challenges:*** Managing Socrata API pagination for large hourly ridership datasets; Geocoding event locations and spatially joining to nearest station complexes (within 600-800m); Defining clean event windows and handling overlapping permits; Handling missing hourly observations (~1% of records)

**Planned Timeline**  

* **Nov 8-12:** Initial data pulls; create exploratory plots; define weather and event indicators
* **Nov 10-14:** Project review meeting with teaching team
* **Nov 15-30:** Complete EDA, fit models, conduct sensitivity analyses, draft report
* **Dec 1-6:** Finalize report and website; record screencast
* **Dec 6, 11:59 PM:** Submit final deliverables
* **Dec 11:** In-class project discussion
